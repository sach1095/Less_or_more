# Less_or_more
My first programme in C

Whene i start programing in C, i was now for learning i will do practice, and what more good then write a mini-game ?

For dis reason i startwitch Less_or_more the most simple game ever.

Yes is simple, but not when you need do it in language who not know.

What i learn in the first version ?

 - How compile C file
 - What is header file (librairy)
 - While, do while, if, else if
 - Switch
 - Srand (how get a random number)
 - Printf
 - Scanf

One week afther learning and training C programing, i decide to add my new stuff on it.

So i create the V2, what i add to it ?

I not add new function, i was learn how write clean code.

My first version was do 113 line.

The V2 ? juste 64 line for the same thing juste more clean.

Thanks You if someone read dis one days.
